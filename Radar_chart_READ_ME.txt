This project is to create radarcharts.

It includes 3 polygons

The 'Radar_chart.csv' is a table that shows you what's your totem animal.
	- 0 is for the white polygon
	- 100 is the average
	- Last value should be random(0-200) for each animal
	
Run a '= RANDBETWEEN (0, 200)' function in excel and save to .csv
Use the table to create the plot and found what's your totem animal!
