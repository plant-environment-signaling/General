# General
Welcome to the general repository of EvP. This repository is meant to collect the different EvP scripts, so that everybody can use them.

Here are some general guidelines:
1. Always upload your code together with a Read me file. Example: code.R, together with codeREADME.txt
2. In that read me file, state the language of your code (R, pyhton etc.), and briefly summarize what the code is for.
3. If it is for data processing in any way, please also add an Excel file or link to the original database that you use to load your data into the script. Make sure you dummy the file, as this is all open. Everybody can access this. 
4. Please always annotate your code. This is a very important step, and makes it much easier for somebody else within our group to use the code. 

Thanks for sharing your work!
