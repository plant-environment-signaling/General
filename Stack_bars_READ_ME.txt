This project is to create stacked bar plots

The objective is to visualize three related traits (Red - Green - Blue) at once overtime. With some conditions.

The 'Stack_bars.csv' is a table that shows you the amount of red green and blue in one picture of one moss glitched by two different methods
There is also a different way to present the data using the occupation bar plots.
	-> It indicates how much of the total each colour is occupaying in %.

Run a '= RANDBETWEEN (0, 255)' function in excel and save to .csv
